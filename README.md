# Competency, with C
This repository is a disclaimer that, yes, I can and do code in C. I
even enjoy it! :smile: For reasons that are beyond my control, I am
unable to post most of my project work written in the C programming
language, in order to comply with University of Guelph academic
policies.

**You will find no actual code here.**

This repository is a plug for <https://git.krourke.org> &mdash; go there
if you need to access significant project-work written in C.

You will need to request a temporary account to view any code that is
stored there. [Contact](https://krourke.org/contact) me to do so.

Alternatively, take a look at any of the following public repositories:

 * `libtdd` https://github.com/keeferrourke/libtdd

These should give you an idea of what I'm capable of without requesting
access to my private git repositories.

## So, why is this here?
Chances are that you're looking at my Github because you're trying to get
a sense of who I am as a computer scientist/software developer/project
designer/whatever else.

You might be interested in the fact that I know and love C.

Unfortunately, due to [academic policies](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ada-cbs/current-undergraduates/academic-policies)
at the University of Guelph &mdash; where I am currently majoring in
Computer Science &mdash; I am not allowed to share most of the useful code
that I have written as part of my studies, unless I want to commit
_academic misconduct_.

This prospect is scary, which is why I have locked away my
coursework in a private git repository hosted on my personal webserver.

### Don't you love free/libre, open-source software (FLOSS)?
Yes, in fact, I do. I am a strong proponent for FLOSS and free culture.
Often times, I refuse to use proprietary software if there is a free
(as in free speech, not necessarily free beer) software alternative.
My favourite software license is the ISC license, due to its simplicity
and lack of restrictions.

All of my personal [projects](https://krourke.org/projects) are licensed
freely under an appropriate software license or Creative Commons free
culture license.

**I am locking this code away unwillingly**.

## Okay, but how do I verify that you are good at C?
Valid concern. If you can't take my word for it, here are my grades thus
far in all C-like programming courses I have taken since 11th grade.
Languages that were exclusively used in the coursework are marked in
parentheses.

 * 96% &mdash; ICS3UI &mdash; [Grade 11] Introduction to computer science (C++)
 * 92% &mdash; ICS4UI &mdash; [Grade 12] Introduction to computer science (C++)
 * 99% &mdash; CIS1500 &mdash; [1st year] Introduction to programming (C)
 * 91% &mdash; CIS2500 &mdash; [1st year] Intermediate programming (C)
    + It is worth noting that prior to the final exam, I had a 97.8% in
      the course, with 100% on every assignment &mdash; lesson learned,
      sleep is important before a final
 * 98% &mdash; CIS2520 &mdash; [2nd year] Data Structures (C)
 * 100% &mdash; CIS2750 &mdash; [2nd year] Software Systems Development and Integration (C)
    + a.k.a. "Angel of Death"
 
 ### Still unconvinced?
 If you need to see demonstrable C code, for a valid reason (perhaps you
 are a prospective employer?), then please contact me at
 <https://krourke.org/contact> and request an account for my private
 [Gogs](https://gogs.io) installation. I will give you view-only access to
 any relevant repositories stored there.
