# C Data Structures
This repository is a plug for <https://git.krourke.org> &mdash; go there
if you need proof that I can code in C.

You will need to request a temporary account to view any code that is
stored there. [Contact](https://krourke.org/contact) me to do so.

**You will find no actual code here.**

## So, why is this here?
Chances are that you're looking at my Github because you're trying to get
a sense of who I am as a computer scientist/software developer/project
designer/whatever else.

You might be interested in the fact that I know and love C.

Unfortunately, due to [academic policies](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ada-cbs/current-undergraduates/academic-policies)
at the University of Guelph &mdash; where I am currently majoring in
Computer Science &mdash; I am not allowed to share any of the useful code
that I have written as part of my studies, unless I want to commit
_academic misconduct_.

This prospect is scary, which is why I have **locked away** my
coursework in a private git repository hosted on my personal webserver.

### Don't you love free/libre, open-source software (FLOSS)?
Yes, in fact, I do. I am a strong proponent for FLOSS and free culture.
Often times, I refuse to use proprietary software if there is a free
(as in free speech, not necessarily free beer) software alternative.
My favourite software license is the ISC license, due to its simplicity
and lack of restrictions.

All of my [projects](https://krourke.org/projects) are licensed freely
under an appropriate software license or Creative Commons free culture
license.

**I am locking this code away unwillingly**.

## Okay, but how do I verify that you are good at C?
Valid concern. If you can't take my word for it, here are my grades thus
far in all C-like programming courses I have taken since 11th grade.
Languages that were exclusively used in the coursework are marked in
parentheses.

 * 96% &mdash; ICS3UI &mdash; [Grade 11] Introduction to computer science (C++)
 * 92% &mdash; ICS4UI &mdash; [Grade 12] Introduction to computer science (C++)
 * 99% &mdash; CIS1500 &mdash; [1st year] Introduction to programming (C)
 * 91% &mdash; CIS2500 &mdash; [1st year] Intermediate programming (C)
    + It is worth noting that prior to the final exam, I had a 97.8% in
      the course, with 100% on every assignment &mdash; lesson learned,
      sleep is important before a final
 * ??% &mdash; CIS2520 &mdash; [2nd year] Data Structures (C)
    + Currently enrolled
 
 ### Still unconvinced?
 If you need to see demonstrable C code, for a valid reason (perhaps you
 are a prospective employer?), then please contact me at
 <https://krourke.org/contact> and request an account for my private
 [Gogs](https://gogs.io) installation. I will give you view-only access to
 any relevant repositories stored there.
